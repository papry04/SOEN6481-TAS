## What are good practices for ending a canceled project?
## Why do projects fail: 
* Low profitability and/or lowered market potential.
* Competing projects become a higher priority.
* Severe delays to schedule. 
* Change of market needs or requirements.
* Technical issues that cannot be resolved.
* Lack of resources and project planning.
* The outgrowth of the assigned budget and utility.
* Failure of collaboration between the business and client.
* The intended outcome of the project is no longer needed or obsolete.
* Solving the wrong problem.
* Not finding a good Solution.
## How to handle project cancellation: 
* Investigate and approve that the project cancellation is really unavoidable;
* Discuss this issue profoundly with the whole project management team and sponsor;
* Identify the main problems and seek for possible solutions or alternatives;
* Evaluate loses that project cancellation will bring to the organization;
* Consider how to cancel the project in the least painful way (model all possible effects);
* Create a project cancellation strategy to reason and manage project cancellation event;
* Review everything already achieved in context of this project and define how these results can be incorporated into other projects being implemented by the organization;
* Cancel all unwanted contracts with suppliers and consider returning upfront payments;
* Consider how to cease project operations safely and with minimal loses;
* Sell or rent out any unclaimed project assets to compensate for uncollected income;
* Evaluate possibility of selling project ideas, concepts or deliverables to competitors;
* Ensure the team members are fairly compensated and rewarded for their labour;
* Disband the project team and release borrowed materials and equipment;
* Reassign people and resources to other tasks, projects and alternate duties;
* Reintegrate available project results, if any, into other projects or activities of the organization;
* Consider the project insurance options, if any, to find out how they can compensate for loses;
* Contact all minor stakeholders and interested community to announce project cancellation;
* Archive the major project documentation
