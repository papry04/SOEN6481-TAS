## What are good practices for ending a canceled project?
This case study provides an overview of the best practices for ending a canceled project based on the experiences gained during the course of the project. While the project may not have reached its intended conclusion, there is valuable knowledge and insights to be gathered from the experience. The document outlines the steps to be taken to wrap up the project gracefully, including documenting what happened, recognizing individual accomplishments, and conducting a post-project retrospective.

## Documenting What Happened
1. Assessment of Deliverables:

Evaluate the state of deliverables and determine if any can be used or enhanced with minimal effort.
Turn over finished or partially completed deliverables to stakeholders and seek acknowledgment.

2. Final Project Report:

Create a comprehensive final project report summarizing accomplishments.
Clearly state the reasons for project termination and provide a final status summary.
Archive all project data, updating documents to reflect the latest status for potential future reference.

3. Post-Project Retrospective:

* Hold a meeting involving all contributors to discuss openly what happened during the project.
* Emphasize successful processes and achievements before addressing challenges.
* Identify changes that could have improved project outcomes and prioritize recommendations for future projects.
