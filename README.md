## What are good practices for ending a canceled project?
## Why do projects fail: 
* Low profitability and/or lowered market potential.
* Competing projects become a higher priority.
* Severe delays to schedule. 
* Change of market needs or requirements.
* Technical issues that cannot be resolved.
* Lack of resources and project planning.
* The outgrowth of the assigned budget and utility.
* Failure of collaboration between the business and client.
* The intended outcome of the project is no longer needed or obsolete.
* Solving the wrong problem.
* Not finding a good Solution.
## How to handle project cancellation: 
* Investigate and approve that the project cancellation is really unavoidable;
* Discuss this issue profoundly with the whole project management team and sponsor;
* Identify the main problems and seek for possible solutions or alternatives;
* Evaluate loses that project cancellation will bring to the organization;
* Consider how to cancel the project in the least painful way (model all possible effects);
* Create a project cancellation strategy to reason and manage project cancellation event;
* Review everything already achieved in context of this project and define how these results can be incorporated into other projects being implemented by the organization;
* Cancel all unwanted contracts with suppliers and consider returning upfront payments;
* Consider how to cease project operations safely and with minimal loses;
* Sell or rent out any unclaimed project assets to compensate for uncollected income;
* Evaluate possibility of selling project ideas, concepts or deliverables to competitors;
* Ensure the team members are fairly compensated and rewarded for their labour;
* Disband the project team and release borrowed materials and equipment;
* Reassign people and resources to other tasks, projects and alternate duties;
* Reintegrate available project results, if any, into other projects or activities of the organization;
* Consider the project insurance options, if any, to find out how they can compensate for loses;
* Contact all minor stakeholders and interested community to announce project cancellation;
* Archive the major project documentation
## Empirical Evidence and Examples: 

* A study by the Project Management Institute (PMI) found that 71% of canceled projects were due to shifting business priorities or lack of resources. Effective communication and transparency could have helped address these issues (PMI, 2019).

* A real-life example of project termination is the cancellation of the Google+ social network in 2019. Google was transparent about the reasons for discontinuation, citing low user engagement and data security concerns. This approach helped manage public expectations and prevent potential legal disputes (Google, 2019).
