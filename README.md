## What are good practices for ending a canceled project?
## Why do projects fail: 
* Low profitability and/or lowered market potential.
* Competing projects become a higher priority.
* Severe delays to schedule. 
* Change of market needs or requirements.
* Technical issues that cannot be resolved.
* Lack of resources and project planning.
* The outgrowth of the assigned budget and utility.
* Failure of collaboration between the business and client.
* The intended outcome of the project is no longer needed or obsolete.
* Solving the wrong problem.
* Not finding a good Solution.
## How to handle project cancellation: 
* Investigate and approve that the project cancellation is really unavoidable;
* Discuss this issue profoundly with the whole project management team and sponsor;
* Identify the main problems and seek for possible solutions or alternatives;
* Evaluate loses that project cancellation will bring to the organization;
* Consider how to cancel the project in the least painful way (model all possible effects);
* Create a project cancellation strategy to reason and manage project cancellation event;
* Review everything already achieved in context of this project and define how these results can be incorporated into other projects being implemented by the organization;
* Cancel all unwanted contracts with suppliers and consider returning upfront payments;
* Consider how to cease project operations safely and with minimal loses;
* Sell or rent out any unclaimed project assets to compensate for uncollected income;
* Evaluate possibility of selling project ideas, concepts or deliverables to competitors;
* Ensure the team members are fairly compensated and rewarded for their labour;
* Disband the project team and release borrowed materials and equipment;
* Reassign people and resources to other tasks, projects and alternate duties;
* Reintegrate available project results, if any, into other projects or activities of the organization;
* Consider the project insurance options, if any, to find out how they can compensate for loses;
* Contact all minor stakeholders and interested community to announce project cancellation;
* Archive the major project documentation
## Empirical Evidence and Examples: 
* Google Wave: In 2010, Google canceled its collaborative online communication and productivity platform, Google Wave. Despite high expectations, the project was canceled due to its complexity and difficulties in gaining user adoption.

* Microsoft Courier: Microsoft's dual-screen tablet project, known as the Courier, was highly anticipated. However, in 2010, Microsoft decided to cancel the project, citing concerns about meeting consumer expectations and competition.

* Boeing Sonic Cruiser: Boeing's Sonic Cruiser project aimed to develop a faster and more fuel-efficient passenger airplane. It was canceled in 2002 due to concerns about the aircraft's economic viability and the impact of the 9/11 attacks on the aviation industry.

* Segway Centaur: The Segway Centaur was intended to be a self-balancing, four-wheeled electric vehicle. It was canceled before production began due to financial difficulties and a changing market landscape.

* Nokia MeeGo: Nokia's MeeGo operating system was intended to compete with iOS and Android. However, it was canceled in favor of a partnership with Microsoft to use the Windows Phone operating system.

* AOL's Patch: AOL's ambitious hyperlocal news project, Patch, aimed to deliver community-specific news. It faced financial challenges and was scaled back significantly, resulting in many layoffs and closures of local Patch websites.

* Google Glass (1st Generation): Google's initial foray into smart glasses, Google Glass, generated significant buzz but faced privacy concerns and limited real-world applications. The project was canceled in its original form in 2015, though it evolved into enterprise applications.

* Apple's Titan Car Project: Apple's secretive autonomous electric car project, codenamed "Project Titan," faced difficulties, including leadership changes and unclear objectives. The company shifted its focus from building a car to developing autonomous driving technology and software.
